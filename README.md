## Product Description
Sir Maverick is an advanced forex trading robot designed to identify market efficiencies and execute trades automatically. This code provides a sample implementation of the Sir Maverick algorithm.

### Algorithm Overview
The Sir Maverick algorithm follows a simple yet effective trading strategy. It calculates the risk/reward ratio based on user-defined inputs and current market conditions. The algorithm then determines the stop loss and take profit levels for each trade. It also incorporates a trailing stop feature to protect profits.

### Key Features
- Risk and reward percentage control for each trade
- Adjustable stop loss and take profit levels
- Trailing stop to lock in profits
- Option to use custom settings

   - reward: Reward percentage per trade
   - stopLossPercentage: Stop loss percentage
   - trailingStopDistance: Trailing stop distance
   - trailingStopStep: Trailing stop step
   - useCustomSettings: Flag to enable custom settings
